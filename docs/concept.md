# Creatine Funnel Site Generator - Concept

## Overview

This is a **site generator tool** designed to empower marketing teams to create funnel pages for creatine products without requiring direct developer intervention for content creation.

## How It Works

The generator follows a streamlined workflow:

1. **Template Selection**: Marketing team members select or upload an HTML/CSS template that defines the layout structure with clearly marked content slots and image placeholders.

2. **Configuration Wizard**: Users fill out a form specifying:
   - Product name
   - Primary keyword
   - Target demographics
   - Desired tone of voice
   - Other marketing parameters

3. **AI Content Generation** (Optional): The system can automatically generate appropriate content for each defined slot in the template using AI, based on the provided configuration.

4. **Preview**: A full-page preview of the generated funnel site is displayed, allowing the marketing team to review the result.

5. **Export for Development**: Once satisfied, users can export a ready-to-deploy package (static HTML/CSS or React components with JSON data) that can be handed off to the development team for final integration.

## Goal

Reduce iteration time between marketing and development teams by allowing marketing to prototype and refine funnel content independently, while still maintaining clean, developer-friendly output for production deployment.
